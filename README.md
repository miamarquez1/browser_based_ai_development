# browser_based_ai_development

A browser-based Streak Counter app — no frameworks, no build tools, just HTML and CSS (with JavaScript added in later steps).

## How to open the project locally

You don't need to install anything. Follow the steps below.

### 1. Get the code onto your laptop

**Option A — Clone with Git** (recommended if you have Git installed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miamarquez1/browser_based_ai_development.git
cd browser_based_ai_development
```

**Option B — Download as a ZIP** (no Git required):

1. Go to <https://github.com/miamarquez1/browser_based_ai_development>
2. Click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**
3. Unzip the downloaded file anywhere on your laptop

### 2. Open the app in your browser

Inside the folder you just cloned or unzipped, navigate to:

```
browser_based_ai_development/index.html
```

Double-click `index.html` — it will open directly in your default web browser. No server or install needed.

> **Tip:** If you'd prefer to use a local server (e.g. to avoid any browser restrictions on local files), run this in your terminal from the repo root:
>
> ```bash
> python3 -m http.server 8080
> ```
>
> Then visit <http://localhost:8080/browser_based_ai_development/> in your browser.
