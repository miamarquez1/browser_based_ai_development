# browser_based_ai_development

A browser-based Streak Counter app 

## How to open the project locally

You don't need to install anything. Follow the steps below.

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miamarquez1/browser_based_ai_development.git
cd browser_based_ai_development
```

### 2. Switch to the project branch

The project files live on the `copilot/add-streak-counter-feature` branch while the PR is open. After cloning, switch to it:

```bash
git checkout copilot/add-streak-counter-feature
```

You should now see a `browser_based_ai_development/` folder containing `index.html` and `style.css`.

> **Once this PR is merged into `main`**, step 2 is no longer needed — the files will be on `main` and visible immediately after cloning.

### 3. Open the app in your browser

Inside the repo folder, navigate to:

```
browser_based_ai_development/index.html
```

Double-click `index.html` — it opens directly in your default web browser. No server or install needed.

> **Optional local server:** run the following from the repo root, then visit <http://localhost:8080/browser_based_ai_development/>
>
> ```bash
> python3 -m http.server 8080
> ```
